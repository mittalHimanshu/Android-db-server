# Android-db-validation-server

<a href="https://github.com/mittalHimanshu/Android-db-validation-server/blob/master/index.jsp"> Click Here </a> for the source code.

In this project a validation on a form is performed in an android app.

The validation response comes directly from the server and displayed in the app.

# Features

```
1. It is mandatory for a user to fill all the fields.
2. A user needs to set a unique username for its registration.
3. A user needs to enter a phone no. according to Indian Standards i.e. 10 digits and starting with either 7 or 8 or 9.
4. A user needs to enter a valid email address.
5. Only a registered user can Login with its unique username and password.
6. If a user enters a wrong username then a toast will appear saying "No Username Found".
7. If a user enters correct username but incorrect password then a toast will appear saying "Password Incorrect". 
```
No hardcoded validations are used inside app for `Security Purpose` as validation is a thing which cannot be tampered with.
